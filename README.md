# Ahteeg

App to showcase various different ciphers, and hash functions.
Includes encryption, decryption and checksum finder in an intuitive tabbed layout.
Includes graphs to visualize time taken and ranks each algorithm accordingly.
Proper error handling and edge cases are taken care of.

## Ciphers:

- Playfair cipher
- Vignere cipher
- Caeser cipher
- Railfence cipher

## Hash Functions:

MD5, SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384 and SHA-512 algorithms.

## Doing more:

Adding new ciphers/hash functions is as easy as it gets. Just add an entry in enums, and add its helper function. No changes are required in UI.
